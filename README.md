# BRAKE-FAULT-DETECTOR-USING-IC-555
A Brake Fault Detector Using IC 555 is a simple circuit designed to monitor the proper functioning of a vehicleâ€™s braking system. It typically uses the IC 555 timer as a monostable multivibrator or astable mode to process the signal from the brake system sensor, ensuring the brakes are operational.
